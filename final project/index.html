    <h1>Our First Attempt at Becoming Famous?</h1>
    <h2>By Michelle Rojas</h2>
    <p>The story is about a group of friends (Elaine, Raine, Robin, and Charlie) making their own reality show on YouTube to make them the most famous people at school. Each character has different talents they want to promote to the world so they could get a future on thier skills. Besides it's better off to start off young, right?" In this excerpt of the webcomic, we have the group in Robin's house, Elaine tells the group her idea of the project (how it all began).</p>
        <p>Why did you make it? At the time when the final presentation was announced I was in a creative block (thanks spring break). But I read The Babysitters Club (comics) when I was younger, with young women having different personalities, skills and wanting to do entrepreneurship.
